## We decided to develop a workout app for iOS called Spotter. Spotter is made to make it easier for users to create a workout schedule and stay on track.

## After inputting some information about themselves and some in-app diagnostic tests, users are provided a customized workout regiment that evolves in variety and difficulty as the app learns more about the user. 

In addition to this, the app will incentivize users to stay active by implementing a scoring system that tracks users' progress over time and places them on a leaderboard based on their commitment to staying on schedule. We also implemented an option to add a timer to help users fully commit to what theyâ€™re doing.

## Project was made by using Adobe XD and Xcode.

## Challenges we ran into was coming up with the idea while also making it to where the user can log into the app.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of is creating the product design, making it to where the user can log into the app, and actually having something to showcase for the Hackathon.
